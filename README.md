uatools.js
==========

A set of tools to help you analyse user agent strings. The intent is not to provide a tool to help sniffing user agent
but to help web developers to suggest right associated app based on right operating system.

You can try it live here: https://mmiszy.github.io/uatools.js/

Once referenced, uatools.js allows you to call:
* uaTools.getOperatingSystem()
* uaTools.isMobile()
* uaTools.isTablet()

Feel free to contribute to get even more accurate results!
